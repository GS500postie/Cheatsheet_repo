**Cloning a repo:**

In Github, navigate to directory, click **code**, copy the https url.

Open terminal. Change the working directory to the one where you want the code

Type **git clone**, paste the copied url.

Press **enter** to create the clone.

Cd to the cloned repo. Type **git init .**

(git status often to check)

Create a markdown file in the cloned repo on the desktop.

Open the repo in VSCode, do some work for testing purposes.

Back in terminal, **git add .**

Type **git commit -m “message”**

Type **git push -u origin main** as per usual. Seems to work.

**Caching credentials.**

This is when you want to set up a computer for frequent git/github interaction.

Install **Git Credential Manager**.

Navigate to Github docs/get started/caching credentials.
Click on the **instructions in the GCM repo**

We’ll try debian, but I’m going to do that on the downstairs laptop after I have cloned this repo
